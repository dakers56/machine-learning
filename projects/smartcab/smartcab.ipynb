    "In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a *Smartcab* through its environment towards a goal. Since the *Smartcab* is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: **Safety** and **Reliability**. A driving agent that gets the *Smartcab* to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered **unsafe**. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered **unreliable**. Maximizing the driving agent's **safety** and **reliability** would ensure that *Smartcabs* have a permanent place in the transportation industry.\n",

    "|   A+  \t|  Agent commits no traffic violations,<br/>and always chooses the correct action. | Agent reaches the destination in time<br />for 100% of trips. |\n",
    "|   A   \t|  Agent commits few minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 90% of trips. |\n",
    "|   B   \t| Agent commits frequent minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 80% of trips. |\n",
    "|   C   \t|  Agent commits at least one major traffic violation,<br/> such as driving through a red light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 70% of trips. |\n",
    "|   D   \t| Agent causes at least one minor accident,<br/> such as turning left on green with oncoming traffic.       \t| Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "|   F   \t|  Agent causes at least one major accident,<br />such as driving through a red light with cross-traffic.      \t| Agent fails to reach the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",

The car avoids major traffic violations such as an accident because it never moves at all.

The first, \"learning\", means that the agent will actually adapt its actions to the environment based on rewards - i.e., it will learn (the default is False, meaning that the agent always does the same thing. The second, \"enforce_deadline\", indicates that the actions will be penalized based on the amount of time remaining in the trial. This penalty is then taken into account when determining the reward the agent is assigned based on performing a particular action. Because the penalty is inversely proportional to the amount of time remaining, the agent is incentivized to achieve the goal as soon as possible. Finally, we have the \"log_metrics\" flag. This falg simply determines whether the results of the experiment will be logged to a file, thereby allowing us to investigate the results after the experiment is over. The function \"act\" is called to perform an action. It also checks whether an action is valid before performing it. The \"render\" function is used for the GUI, and the \"render_text\" function is not. The \"next_waypoint()\" function checks the East/West direction first."

    "**Answer:** The following all pertain to the \"no_learning\" experiment.\n",
    "The agent makes bad decisions ~40-44% of the time. 25% of the time, accidents are caused (i.e., ~56% of bad decisions lead to accident).\n",
    "The driver received an \"F\" for reliability. It seems reasonable because the driver is choosing directions at random AND we are enforcing a time deadline. If the driver were allowed to continue indefinitely, we would expect them to eventually get to the destination, but capping the amount of time means that the driver is not likely to get to their destination simply by choosing random actions.\n",
    "The 10 trial rolling average rarely goes above -5, and is always negative and below -4. Therefore, it seems that the driving agent is being penalized heavily.\n",
    "After running 10,15,20,25 and 30 trials, respectively, the relative frequency of bad actions tends towards 35%. Minor violations and major violations trend downwards as well, but by less than 5%. Major accidents, however, seem to be relatively steady. The reliability moves up strongly, from near 0% at 10 trials to near 40% for 30 trials\n",
    "This smartcab could be under no circumstances considered safe based on the decision mechanism of taking a random action. In short, this is because it seems likely that, no mater how many trials we perform, this car will get into far too many accidents, although the number of moving violations overall may improve with a greater number of trials. The car will perform a bad action betwen 3 and 4 out of every ten times. Considering how many \"actions\" a car takes on a given trip (number of turns, etc) this would equate to tens or even hundreds of moving violations every time the car takes a trip! However, the number of violations does seem to go down as more trials are performed. In reality, we could performs thousands upon thousands of trials, and perhaps improve the number of bad actions to a reasonable level. However, >5% of the time, a major accident occurs. Considering that most trips will take more than 20 actions, this means that for almost any trip, the car is expected to get in a MAJOR accident, which should not be the case, obviously. Contrary tobad actions overall, however, the number of major accidents does not seem to significantly move as more trials are performed. Therefore, we seem to need a better model for choosing actions, and not simply take more time to perform more iterations of the experiment, meaning that this car could not be considered safe. Reliability, however, may get better as the number of trials increases. We saw a 40% increase simply by increasing the number of trials from 10 to 30. It may be feasible to increase the number of trials to a point where we achieve an acceptable rate of reliability. However, it is not likely that this is the most effective means of arriving at a destination because a random route is being chosen. So in some sense, perhaps we conuld consider a car that chooses actions randomly \"reliable\", but it is likely a very weak sense."

Looking at the reward scheme, the reward is discounted depending on how much time remains until the deadline. This is the same function that the \"deadline\" feature would have to provide. It may turn out that the reward scheme does not do so as well as the deadline feature would, but if it does satsfactorily replace the deadline feature, we could see a drastic improvement in performance because \"deadline\" could have a relatively high number of states if the number of trials is high. Even in the simple experiments we have carried out so far, we have had 10 trials, which would mean there are at least ten states for deadline. Considering the other features have fewer than 5 states, this is an \"expensive\" feature, and we could do well to remove it. 'Inputs' are primarily relevant for safety because they determine the permissible moves for the smartcab. The rules of the road are wholly determined by the light, position of other cars at the intersection and the agent's desired direction of travel. The first two are provided by 'inputs'. However, the agent's desired direction of travel is provided by the 'waypoint' feature, meaning that waypoint also bears some relevance to safety. Also note that 'waypoint' is the optimal direction of travel for the agent, meaning that it is relevant to both safety and efficiency."

Of course, additional benefits come from Q-Learning, such that we can have the agent choose the *best* action for each state based on the Q-values of each state-action pair possible.

    "**Answer:** The first thing I noticed was that the number of bad actions and major violations began at a substantially lower level, and trended down more sharply than in the default agent. Major violations behaved similarly. This shows that we were improving regarding the total number of bad actions taken and major violations. However, the number of minor accidents actually increased, while there was little difference in the number of major accidents. The increase in minor accidents makes some sense because a minor accident may occur when a driver takes a left into oncoming traffic, and the default learner never turned left. But the lack of improvements in major accidents shows that we are still performing equally badly as the default model when it comes to situations like running red lights into crossing traffic. The agent required 20 trials before testing, which makes perfect sense given our starting epsilon of 1, and the decay rate of .05 / trial. Also, the average reward increased steadily, but still remained negative. This means that we were learning some (b/c the average reward increased), but the fact that the reward remained solidly negative (barely crossing -2) indicates that our model still has a lot of learning to do. This makes sense given that we got safety/reliability ratings of F and F, respectively, meaning that our model has a long way to go. The safety and reliability ratings are the same as for the agent which chose actions randomly, but I would still call this model an improvement because of the strong decrease in total bad actions and major violations and increase in average reward. Moreover, the upward trend in reward suggests that maybe we could imporve the model with more trials, and also carefully managing the decay function to ensure that a proper number of the trials are used for exploration vs. exploitation."

    "## Improve the Q-Learning Driving Agent\n",
    "The third step to creating an optimized Q-Learning agent is to perform the optimization! Now that the Q-Learning algorithm is implemented and the driving agent is successfully learning, it's necessary to tune settings and adjust learning paramaters so the driving agent learns both **safety** and **efficiency**. Typically this step will require a lot of trial and error, as some settings will invariably make the learning worse. One thing to keep in mind is the act of learning itself and the time that this takes: In theory, we could allow the agent to learn for an incredibly long amount of time; however, another goal of Q-Learning is to *transition from experimenting with unlearned behavior to acting on learned behavior*. For example, always allowing the agent to perform a random action during training (if $\\epsilon = 1$ and never decays) will certainly make it *learn*, but never let it *act*. When improving on your Q-Learning implementation, consider the implications it creates and whether it is logistically sensible to make a particular adjustment."

    "**Answer:** The function ultimately used for epsilon was abs(cos(.001t)). The first thing I looked for in a function was that near 0 trials, the output was high (near 1). I made this decision because in early trials (i.e., close to 0 on the x axis) the agent would not have much prior experience to draw upon (exploit), so I thought it would be beneficial for it to explore more. Epsilon expresses the probability of trying a new action, therefore, I wanted a high epsilon value for low trial values. Cosine seemed like a natural fit because cos(0) = 1. However, cos also takes negative values, so I took the absolute value. I tried the other suggested functions, but cosine was also the only one of the suggested functions that received a non-F score in both reliability and safety on the first try, so I decided to keep experimenting with it. I also noticed that smaller a values led to an uptick in performance, so I kept decreasing the size of a until I got a satisfactory score. However, the smaller values of a lengthened the period of cos(at), meaning that more trials were necessary. I tried many different alpha values, and noticed that I was only getting values above a 'D' for reliability when I used a high alpha value. This could be thought of as combatting the low bias in our model for reliability by increasing the importance of each and every data point. This Q-learner received the maximum possible marks for both reliability and safety, trouncing the default model (which simply chose a random action at all times). Because it received the maximum possible marks, I am satisifed with the smartcab, and believe that it has learned an appropriate policy. However, I will also note that training the model did take a decent (40 min- 1 hr) of time."

    "### Define an Optimal Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the answer to the important question *\"what am I trying to get my agent to learn?\"* only has a theoretical answer and cannot be concretely described. Here, however, you can concretely define what it is the agent is trying to learn, and that is the U.S. right-of-way traffic laws. Since these laws are known information, you can further define, for each state the *Smartcab* is occupying, the optimal action for the driving agent based on these laws. In that case, we call the set of optimal state-action pairs an **optimal policy**. Hence, unlike some theoretical answers, it is clear whether the agent is acting \"incorrectly\" not only by the reward (penalty) it receives, but also by pure observation. If the agent drives through a red light, we both see it receive a negative reward but also know that it is not the correct behavior. This can be used to your advantage for verifying whether the **policy** your driving agent has learned is the correct one, or if it is a **suboptimal policy**."

    "**Answer:** My 'state' dictionary is defined as follows: { smartcab_desired_direction, light, left, right, oncoming } An optimal policy would entail that whenever the smartcab has the right of way and a green light, it goes in the optimal direction. Otherwise, it waits until it does have the right of way. Theoretically, it could be possible that the car could benefit by taking a detour if, e.g, the cab wanted to turn left but there were multiple cars traveling straight in the other direction. However, because we are not considering future states (i.e.,those along the detour) this is not relevant. Therefore, whenever the car has a green light and desires to go straight or right, it should go straight. Whenever the car has a green light and desires to left, it should go left unless the other driver is going straight. And on a red light, the car should idle unless it desires to turn right AND there is no car crossing the intersection in the direction perpendicular to the smartcab. Even though the smartcab scored A+ for both safety and reliability, there are still some states for which it does NOT learn the optimal policy. For example ('left', 'green', 'left', None, 'forward') should idle because the oncoming car wants to go forward and has the right of way, but \"left\" has the highest reward (Rewards: left:1.57, right:.3, forward:0, None:0). Another example is ('left', 'red', None, 'right', 'left') which has rewards (forward : -10.43, None : 0.00, right : 1.64, left : -9.50). Right has the highest q-value, but the car's desired direction of travel is left, meaning that this state does not follow the desired waypoint. Note that this is another \"type\" of failure than the first example, because the rules of the road are observed (there is no car on the left, so there is no car in the intersection blocking the right on red). Contrarily, in the first example, the smartcab drive across the intersection with a car oncoming, which violates the rules of the road. So the model does not only fail the rules of the road OR the determined waypoints, but instead intermittently violates both. It is unsurprising that the model struggles when the desired durection of travel is left, because this is when right-of-way issues may prevail. The fact that the smartcab scored well but did not learn the optimal policy in each situation tells me that the states with incorrect policies were not visited often. Take, for instance, ('left', 'green', 'left', None, 'forward'). This state could cause an accident because the car would be turning into oncoming traffic. If the agent got in a lot of such accidents, it would not score well. But it did score well, so it must not have come up against this state very often on a relative basis. Perhaps this speaks to the fact that Q-learning will approach the proper Q value as the number of trials grows arbitrarily large - meaning that there is no guarantee that we achieve the correct result for any \"small\" number of trials. On the other hand, the cab obtained the best possible scores, so it must have determined the best actions for some states. One such example is ('left', 'green', 'forward', None, None). In this situation, there is no oncoming car so the agent is allowed to make the left. Given that the Q-values are (forward : -0.29, None : 0.00, right : 0.00 ,left : 9.39), left has the highest value and will be chosen."

    "Curiously, as part of the Q-Learning algorithm, you were asked to **not** use the discount factor, `'gamma'` in the implementation. Including future rewards in the algorithm is used to aid in propagating positive rewards backwards from a future state to the current state. Essentially, if the driving agent is given the option to make several actions to arrive at different states, including future rewards will bias the agent towards states that could provide even more rewards. An example of this would be the driving agent moving towards a goal: With all actions and rewards equal, moving towards the goal would theoretically yield better rewards if there is an additional reward for reaching the goal. However, even though in this project, the driving agent is trying to reach a destination in the allotted time, including future rewards will not benefit the agent. In fact, if the agent were given many trials to learn, it could negatively affect Q-values!"

    "**Answer:** The smartcab itself cannot sense anything other than the cars at its current intersection, meaning that it will not be able to accurately judge the rewards for intermediate steps. Essentially, the car has no way to predict which states will occur between the current state and the final state. For instance, suppose the car is in a state 'A' and is \"tempted\" by a future state C. The car has no idea what will occur in the intermediate state B, and thereforce could accidentally be penalized if it ends up in a poor state, canceling out the future gain! The problem with the environment is that the state contains no information about which intersection the agent is currently at. Because of this, the agent cannot determine whether some future state is attainable, and cannot predict the intermediate rewards either. For instance, suppose the agent in state S0 is \"tempted\" by some state S1 such that S1's deadline feature is less than S0 (because it will take some number of moves to get from S0 --> S1). Moreover, suppose that S0:deadline - S1:deadline = r (S1 is r moves away from S0). There is more than just one intersection which is r moves away from S0. For instance, it could go straight r times, or if r is even, go backwards once for every time it goes forward (never turning) and end up at the same intersection! If the latter did happen, the agent could be in S1 (depending on the state of other cars, which we are ignoring for the moment), and yet get a lesser reward than expected because there are fewer moves remaining and the agent is no closer to its target! Then adding this lesser reward would lower the Q-value of S1, demonstrating how the Q-value could fall with more trials."
